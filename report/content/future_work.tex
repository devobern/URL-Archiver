\section{Future Work}
The future vision for the URL-Archiver project includes a host of enhancements to extend its capabilities and user experience.
These potential additions, formulated within our project's limited timeframe, include:

- Adding more archiving services for a broader reach.
- Expanding support for various input file types.
- Implementing a user-friendly graphical interface.
- Enabling multilingual support for global accessibility.
- Automatically archiving all URLs in a file for efficiency.
- Providing more detailed setting options for user customization.
- Publishing the application in package repositories to simplify installation.
- Improving the code layout, like breaking up the controller for better clarity.

Integrating services such as Memento Time Travel would expand our archiving capabilities and provide a wider historical perspective.
Adapting the application to handle various file formats like .docx could increase its relevance in various other settings.
The introduction of a graphical user interface is another key area, which would dramatically improve user interaction, making the tool more accessible and engaging, particularly for those less versed in CLI environments.
Adding multilingual support is also crucial, as it would break down language barriers, enhancing the tool's usability.
The proposed enhancements, such as automatic URL archiving, detailed settings, application publishing in repositories, and code layout improvements like refactoring the controller, collectively aim to not only improve the tool's functionality and user experience but also to ensure better maintainability and ease of future extensions.
