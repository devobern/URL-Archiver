\subsection{Epics and User Stories}
In this section, we outline the main features (Epics) of the project and break them down into detailed user tasks (User Stories). This helps provide a clear understanding of the desired functions and behaviors of our software.

\subsection{Functional requirements}
The URL-Archiver project, as described in the task document, is designed to be a platform-independent Java program that performs several key functions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Processing:} It accepts directories or files (including various text and PDF formats) as input and scans them for URLs.
    \item \textbf{URL Extraction:} The program extracts all URLs using regular expressions.
    \item \textbf{Optional Browser Interaction:} It has an optional feature to open URLs in a web browser.
    \item \textbf{URL Archiving:} The program posts URLs to an archiving service (archive.today \& WayBackMachine) and retrieves the archived URLs.
    \item \textbf{Output Generation:} It outputs a CSV file containing the original and archived URL pairs.
    \item \textbf{Optional File Integration:} The program can optionally insert archived URLs into a .BIB file.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, the project emphasizes minimal, modular, and self-explanatory code. The report for the project is expected to be concise and include this project description.

\subsection{Boundary}
The following limits apply:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input:} The application processes only text files (e.g.: .BIB, .TEX; .HTML; etc.) and PDF files
    \item \textbf{Output:} The application exports the extracted and archived URLs only as CSV or direct in a BIB file
    \item \textbf{Archiving:} The application supports at the moment only archive.today and WayBackMachine (for restrictions on the APIs of these services, please refer to the documentation of the archiving services themselves)
\end{itemize}
\clearpage
\subsection{Pre-conditions}
For the application to run smoothly, the following pre-conditions must be met:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Java Environment:} The application requires a Java runtime environment to be installed on the system where it will be executed.
    \item \textbf{File Formats:} The software is designed to work with specific file formats, primarily text and PDF files. Ensuring these are the file types provided is necessary for successful operation.
    \item \textbf{Archiving Service Access:} The application needs access to an internet connection and web archiving services, such as archive.ph, for URL archiving functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Login + S3 Credentials (WayBackMachine only):} For archiving with the WayBackMachine a login and S3-Credentials are required.
\end{itemize}
