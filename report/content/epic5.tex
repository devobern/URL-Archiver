\textbf{Goal}: Provide the user with an organized CSV file detailing URLs and their archived counterparts. Also, allow for integration of archived URLs back into supported input files.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Generate CSV File}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Description}: As a user, I want the system to produce a CSV file containing all original URLs and their corresponding archived URLs.
        \item \textbf{Acceptance Criteria}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A CSV file is generated upon completion of the archiving process.
            \item Each row in the CSV contains the original URL and its archived counterpart.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Integrate Archived URLs into Supported Files}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Description}: If desired, I want the system to insert the archived URL back into the original file, following its corresponding original URL.
        \item \textbf{Acceptance Criteria}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system recognizes supported file types for this integration process.
            \item Upon user approval, the archived URL is inserted in the appropriate location (e.g., following its original URL) within the file.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
