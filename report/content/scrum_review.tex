\subsection{Review Project Setup}
This chapter reflects on the initial setup and organization of our project.

\subsubsection{Initial Situation}
Our project began with an in-depth analysis of the provided functional and non-functional requirements.
We used the initial project description as a guiding framework and scheduled a meeting with our coach, Dr. Simon Kramer, to clarify any ambiguities.
This analysis led to several key insights:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application must be platform-independent and developed in Java.
    \item The code should be minimalistic, modular, and self-explanatory.
    \item A public repository is required for code availability.
    \item We depend on external resources like Archive Today and Apache PDFBox.
    \item A console application is preferred, eliminating the need for a graphical interface.
\end{itemize}

This systematic approach allowed us to create a modular and extendable codebase.
When the integration of the Wayback Machine was later introduced as a requirement by our stakeholder, our well-structured codebase enabled us to agilely accommodate this new feature.
This addition was assessed to ensure it added value to the project and didn't become a blocker, demonstrating the effectiveness of our initial analysis and flexible project approach.

\subsubsection{Subject analysis}
In our subject analysis, we thoroughly researched necessary external resources, focusing on Archive Today and the Wayback Machine.
Our investigation included their automation interfaces, REST API support, and potential challenges such as Captcha and login requirements.
We also ensured these resources were compatible with our FLOSS licensing requirement.
This study allowed us to design an initial user interaction model and provided a clear roadmap for our application's development, facilitating a smooth transition into the coding phase.

\subsubsection{Stakeholder(-Management)}
Our stakeholder management focused on effective communication with our primary stakeholder, Dr. Simon Kramer.
We efficiently addressed any uncertainties by scheduling regular meetings with Dr. Kramer, utilizing our designated Project 1 timeslot.
This approach allowed for straightforward and effective resolution of questions and alignment of project deliverables.

\subsubsection{Organisation}
Our team's organization was based on agile principles, with scheduled Monday and Friday meetings serving as our Scrum events.
These structured sessions were complemented by self-organized meetings among team members as needed, facilitating code reviews, quick resolution of questions, or addressing any issues.
This agile approach ensured effective communication and collaboration, which was vital for the project's smooth progression.

\subsubsection{Installations}
For our project installations, we established a GitHub repository and a Jira project on Atlassian.net, ensuring efficient collaboration.
Our first week involved defining objectives and creating epics in Jira.
We also updated our IDEs and installed the latest Java version for consistency.
Reflecting back, an early setup of a basic code structure would have been beneficial, potentially minimizing the need for later refactoring.

\subsection{Lessons learned}

\subsubsection{Team}
Our team gained valuable experience from Project 1, learning to balance part-time study with software development. Implementing the Scrum methodology was challenging due to our limited time, but it highlighted the importance of adaptability and efficient planning. We tailored our approach, focusing on effective communication and workload distribution.

In summary, Project 1 was a valuable experience that taught us the importance of balancing teamwork and individual responsibilities. It has prepared us for future challenges in software development.

\subsubsection{Nicolin Dora}
Developing and managing my first software project from scratch was a great experience.
However, working with SCRUM was challenging as we could only work on weekends or evenings due to part-time study.
This made it difficult to use SCRUM effectively, and planning and report preparation took almost as much time as product development.
In principle, SCRUM is a useful method as it allows for easy tracking of project progress.
However, the students could have been given more freedom in this project to simplify the method.

I enjoyed the teamwork and appreciated the goal-oriented approach.
It was interesting to balance the different demands on quality.
Dr. Kramer and Mr. Helbling were always available to answer questions, which made collaboration easier.
For future projects, I plan to use a slimmed-down version of SCRUM, depending on the complexity of the project.
I am determined to improve my planning and communication within the team right from the start.

\subsubsection{Abidin Vejseli}
Project 1 has been an enriching yet demanding journey, requiring meticulous time management and organization from my side.
The Scrum methodology, which I believe our team adapted effectively, and the complexities of part-time study contributed to this challenge.
Personally, I felt the initial module introduction was rather lengthy and could be condensed to the essential material.
It was unfortunate not to have both coaches at the presentation, which was an aspect that I missed.

Working within the team was a positive experience, and I'm proud of how we distributed the workload, ensuring valuable learning for everyone.
The interaction with our coaches was a highlight, their readiness to assist was something I greatly appreciated.
For the next project, I aim to start and ideally complete my user stories during the first half of the sprint.

\subsubsection{Killian Wampfler}
For me, Project 1 was a great refresher for my programming skills and software development techniques.
As I already use the Scrum method in my company, this part wasn't new to me.
However, it was interesting to use the Scrum method in such a small team (3 people).
Also, the team worked really well together and I think we could all learn something from this project.

Personally, I learned two things from this project.
First, my unit tests have a lot of room for improvement (in quality and quantity).
And more importantly, my git commit messages weren't the norm.
Because of this, our git repository doesn't look consistent, and as this project needs to be publicly accessible, this is not desired.

Lastly I really appreciated how much freedom Dr. Kramer gave us and that he always took the time to answer our questions.
